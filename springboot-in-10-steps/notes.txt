Installing the HAL Browser
==============================
The setup for the HAL browser is remarkably easy when building a REST API with Spring. 
As long as we have the dependency "spring-data-rest-hal-explorer", Spring will auto-configure the browser, 
and make it available via the default endpoint.
All we need to do now open new browser. 
The HAL browser will then be available on http://localhost:8080/ 
now type /actuator in Edit Headers text box

### Goals
- Enable building production ready applications quickly
- Provide common non-functional features 
  - embedded servers
  - metrics
  - health checks
  - externalized configuration

### What Spring Boot is NOT!
- ZERO code generation
- Neither an application server nor a web server

### Features
- Quick Starter Projects with Auto Configuration
   - Web
   - JPA
- Embedded Servers - Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow
- Production-ready features
   - metrics and health checks 
   - externalized configuration
