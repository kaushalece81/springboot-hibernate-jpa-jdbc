@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)
If want only single table to have part time employee and full time employee

Additional column inserted 
DTYPE  Distinguisher Type
If want to give proper name "EmployeeType" of column for DTYPE column created in table use
annotation @DiscriminatorColumn(name = "EmployeeType")


/** A single table per class hierarchy. */
    SINGLE_TABLE, 

    /** A table per concrete entity class. */
    TABLE_PER_CLASS, 

    /** 
     * A strategy in which fields that are specific to a 
     * subclass are mapped to a separate table than the fields 
     * that are common to the parent class, and a join is 
     * performed to instantiate the subclass.
     */
    JOINED 


For Table per class change the strategy in Employee class
 InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE) -->InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)
@DiscriminatorColumn(name = "EmployeeType")   this annotation not required here

Now two tables will be created
FULL_TIME_EMPLOYEE 
PART_TIME_EMPLOYEE 
Union was used to retrieve data from both tables

But problem here is common columns [ID and Name ]are getting repeated in both tables
=============================================================================
PART_TIME_EMPLOYEE
ID  	NAME  	HOURLY_WAGE  
1	Jill	50

FULL_TIME_EMPLOYEE		
ID  	NAME  	SALARY  
2	Jack	10008

To solve this problem we should use strategy type JOINED 
In this case we have 3 tables 
EMPLOYEE : ID, NAME
PART_TIME_EMPLOYEE : HOURLY_WAGE
FULL_TIME_EMPLOYEE:  SALARY

EMPLOYEE;	
ID  	NAME  
1	Jill
2	Jack


FULL_TIME_EMPLOYEE;	
SALARY  	ID  
10008	2


PART_TIME_EMPLOYEE;	
HOURLY_WAGE  	ID  
50	1


========================@MappedSuperClas===============================================================
No need to change any query whether we are using 
SINGLE_TABLE strategy
TABLE_PER_CLASS
JOINED

query renamed same 
@NamedQuery(name="find_all_employees", query = "select e from Employee e")

But if we are using @MappedSuperClass annotation then query will change
as Employee is no more Entity
comment //@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED) & //@Entity
use  @MappedSuperClass in Employee class
 *MappedSuperClass  Designates a class whose mapping information is applied 
 * to the entities that inherit from it. A mapped superclass 
 * has no separate table defined for it.

when we start application without changing query it says QuerySyntaxException : Employee is not mapped as its no more entity
so we have to query separately for part time employee and full time employee 

Also we need to modify dao class

comment below
/* public List<Employee> findAllEmployee() {
		 TypedQuery<Employee> createNamedQuery = em.createNamedQuery("find_all_employees",Employee.class);
		List<Employee> resultList = createNamedQuery.getResultList();
		return resultList;
	}
*/

	public List<PartTimeEmployee> findAllEmployee() {
		 TypedQuery<PartTimeEmployee> createNamedQuery = em.createNamedQuery("find_all_part_time_employees",PartTimeEmployee.class);
		List<PartTimeEmployee> resultList = createNamedQuery.getResultList();
		return resultList;
	}
	
Also in Main class 
//	LOGGER.info("List of Employees --> {}", employeeRepository.findAllEmployee());
LOGGER.info("List of Employees --> {}", employeeRepository.findAllPartTimeEmployee());
LOGGER.info("List of Employees --> {}", employeeRepository.findAllFullTimeEmployee());


How to choose which one to use.
=================================
1.If we are concerned more about data integrity & data quality 
then we should choose JOINED because here Common things are in separate Employee table
and specific fields are in separate table so no redundancy here.
 All columns can be nullable and no chance of bad data here

2. If you are worried about performance then SINGLE_TABLE is best to choose
but it effects data integrity and data quality and many nullable columns
